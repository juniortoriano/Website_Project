	<h2><p style="text-align: center;"">A Brief History</p></h2>
	    <p>Niles was established in the 1850s and was a junction point of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Pacific_Transportation_Company" style="color:red">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> lines from Oakland to San Jose and southern coastal points. Vallejo’s Mill was the first flourishing flour mill constructed and completed in this country. It was run by water conducted in a long flume from Alameda Creek. Niles at one time was noted for the location of the California Nursery, the largest nursery in California, with the largest rose plantation in the state.</p> 
	    <p>In 1912, Essanay Studios was at the height of its movie making fame. The studio, owned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broncho_Billy_Anderson" style="color:red">Gilbert M. “Broncho Billy” Anderson</a> and his partner George Spoor, made famous movies of the time starring Charlie Chaplin, Wallace Beery, and Ben Turpin. Many cowboy adventures were filmed through Niles Canyon and along the main streets of Niles. The towns of Niles, Mission San Jose, Centerville, Irvington, and Warm Springs were incorporated into the City of Fremont in 1956.</p>
